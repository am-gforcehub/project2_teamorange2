### Description & Requirements

Get link to Project 2 requirements [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15i7nSFby2ObN3Awxiv1KX7UWiWNq__n6/view?usp=sharing)

The following npm packages were installed:

1. **Dotenv:** Dotenv is a simple way to allow you to create secret keys that your application needs to function and keep them from going public.

   _Command Line: 'npm install dotenv'_

2) **MySQL2:** `Node-MySQL2` offers better performance over `node-mysql`, and also supports additional features MySQL doesn't.

   _Command Line: 'npm i mysql2'_

3.  **Sequelize:** Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

    _Command Line: 'npm i sequelize'_

4.  **Express:** Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.

    _Command Line: 'npm i express'_

5.  **Express-Handlebars:** A Handlebars view engine for Express which doesn't suck. Handlebars.js is an extension to the Mustache templating language created by Chris Wanstrath. Handlebars.js and Mustache are both logicless templating languages that keep the view and the code separated like we all know they should be.

    _Command Line: 'npm i express-handlebars'_
